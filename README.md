# Abide Solar Challenge

How I spent my time:
* Sketching out data model and dashboard mockups in Figma (1 hour)
* Writing a design doc with API definitions (30 min)
* Writing backend and frontend code (2.5 hours)

These would be my next steps:
* Implement remaining backend API endpoints
* Connect them to frontend graphs in operator dashboard
* Setup some kind of noise filtering
* Lastly, build out scientist dashboard
